I am thrilled to introduce you to my brand new blog, a place where I hope to connect, learn, and inspire.

In this corner of the internet, my goal is to share knowledge. One area that is cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. I'm mainly working with VMware Carbon Black and Hack The Box, but it can be much more. I can't wait to delve deeper with you.
