Hi, Welcome to my website. My name is Jennifer Rijnhout and work as a Technical Security Engineer at ITQ since 2022. After almost 25 years working in logistics I have changed my careerpath. In 2021 I started a bootcamp,  1 year in 6 months, in college "Cyber Security, Ethical Hacking". Here I found my love for IT and security. 

At ITQ we work with VMWare Carbon black a NGVA. I configure policies, help customers with questions and go trough alerts. In my free time I like to keep learning by doing courses, play around in Hack the Box and Tryhackme.
